## Introduction

This research's primary objective is the analysis of empirical data. For this investigation, two sets of actual data were acquired. I investigated into and analyzed two separate sets of actual data. A sample of 100 people's US shoe sizes are included in Dataset 1. Dataset 2 was gathered at the University of Texas at Arlington Central Library and looked at the time difference between two students who entered the building through the main door. To better comprehend the population trend based on the sample, the data is statistically aggregated and displayed. In Part I, it is discussed how the assumptions about the distribution that the population follows were derived from the descriptive analysis of the sample. The information from the descriptive statistics 
is utilized in the Chi-square Goodness of Fit-Test. Data classes with enough observations are 
grouped together. The number of observations, Class probability, Class expected value, and 
Chi-square component values are computed for each data class. With the aid of Excel tools, 
the goodness of fit test is carried out to make predictions about the distribution of a 
population based on a sample. The explanation is followed by the chi-square values, degrees 
of freedom, and test conclusions. In Part-II of the paper, the whole procedure for performing the Goodness of Fit test on both data sets to determine the popuplation distributions is described.

### Detailed explaination from data collection to conclusion obtained from goodness of fit test is Report Part-I and Part-II respectively.
